# Ritav.ai — Persistent Project State

## Current phase
Phase 0 — Architecture, threat model and secure foundation; beginning security/runtime integration.

## Source of truth
- `RITAV_BLUEPRINT.md` — engineering implementation contract.
- `RITAV_AI_MASTER_BLUEPRINT.pdf` — user-provided product/design reference.
- `docs/MASTER_REQUIREMENTS_MATRIX.md` — explicit reconciliation of both sources.

## Security foundation status
Implemented baseline deterministic security gates:
- Risk tiers 0–4.
- Scoped capability grants: global/app/capability/action/session shape, with default deny.
- Explicit authorization levels: none, user confirmation, device authentication.
- Financial-action hard block.
- Sensitive-data protection helpers and contextual secret detection/redaction work in progress.
- Emergency stop.
- Local audit event contract with secret-safe action logging.
- Unit tests covering permission boundaries, authorization, finance blocking, emergency stop and secret detection.

## Device compatibility baseline
- Minimum target: Android devices with **4 GB RAM and 32 GB storage**.
- The application must remain functional on this baseline without requiring flagship-class hardware.
- 4 GB/32 GB is a compatibility floor, not a guarantee that every future AI model or advanced feature will fit or run well within those resources.
- Larger-memory/storage devices should automatically receive better performance where available, without changing the security policy.
- Core security, permission, emergency-stop and policy components must stay lightweight and must not depend on large local models.
- Heavy capabilities such as local LLMs, vision, speech models and media processing must use capability-aware resource limits, graceful degradation and cancellation rather than assuming unlimited RAM/CPU/storage.
- Low-memory conditions must fail safely: release resources, cancel optional work, preserve security state, and avoid force-running workloads that can destabilize the app.

## Security/runtime integration completed
- Emergency stop is represented by a centralized process-local `SecurityRuntimeState`.
- Main UI is wired to the same runtime safety state rather than maintaining an unrelated UI-only boolean.
- Emergency stop activation is immediate and does not depend on the AI/model.
- Resume requires explicit user-confirmation signal through the security controller API.
- Final execution is routed through capability and security pipeline checks before an Android adapter can run.
- Android device-authentication integration has been added as a platform gateway; physical-device validation is still required.

## Important security assessment
This is a hardened **foundation**, not a claim of mathematically bug-free or production-complete security. The architecture still requires implementation and testing of Android secure storage/key management, screen/input isolation, identity, accessibility boundaries, network enforcement, app capability registry, confirmation UI/device-auth integration, encrypted audit persistence, prompt-injection defenses, dependency/security scanning, resource-pressure testing and real-device testing before release.

## Security invariants
1. No autonomous consequential action.
2. Never provide OTP, UPI PIN, password, CVV or equivalent secrets to AI reasoning.
3. Financial/UPI automation is denied by default and protected by a dedicated firewall.
4. No hidden telemetry or private-data egress by default.
5. External/app content cannot override security policy.
6. Execution requires valid scoped permission + explicit intent where required + risk-appropriate authorization.
7. Uncertainty blocks or asks; it never guesses.
8. Security policy is deterministic and independent of the AI model.
9. Emergency stop must be authoritative over AI-driven actions in the process.
10. Resuming from emergency stop must never be an AI/model decision.

## Architecture invariant
USER → SECURITY GATE → MASTER ORCHESTRATOR → POLICY → PERMISSION → AUTHORIZATION → EXECUTION → VERIFICATION → AUDIT

## Next implementation target
- Android Keystore-backed key management and encrypted local persistence.
- App capability registry and Android capability adapters.
- Orchestrator contracts with strictly scoped agent capabilities.
- Confirmation/read-back and device-auth flow.
- Prompt-injection/content trust boundary.
- Network egress firewall and data-classification gate.
- Identity/session model.
- Low-memory/resource-budget enforcement and cancellation.
- CI verification, dependency/security scanning and Android build validation.
- Real-device security tests, including 4 GB RAM / 32 GB storage baseline where feasible.
- Later: voice, local AI, Android bridge and app adapters.

## Constraints
- Android OS restrictions are authoritative.
- Accessibility, microphone, camera and background operation are opt-in capabilities and must not be assumed universally available.
- No real-device behavior is claimed until tested on a physical Android device.
- Release signing keys never enter the repository.
- Release APK workflow should be manually triggered rather than building a release for every push.

## Development rule
For each feature: implement → test → security review → update documentation → CI verification → record result here.

## Continuation instruction
A future chat can continue with: “Continue Ritav.ai development. Read `RITAV_PROJECT_STATE.md`, `RITAV_BLUEPRINT.md`, and `docs/MASTER_REQUIREMENTS_MATRIX.md`, inspect the repository, verify the current build/test state, and continue from the next implementation target.”
